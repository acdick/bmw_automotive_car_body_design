# Validating and Updating Structural Finite Element Models for Dynamic Analysis
BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION OF AUTOMOTIVE CAR BODY DESIGNS

As advances in computation develop, more sophisticated Finite Element (FE) models can be generated to simulate the dynamic response of a reference model. One measure of the dynamic response of a structure is through its eigenfrequencies and mode shapes. It therefore becomes necessary to validate the FE data using correlation techniques to assure that it accurately predicts the reference data. Two standard correlation techniques are the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) and the Orthogonality Check (ORTHO), whose results can be used to perform an update of the FE model that minimizes the discrepancy between the FE and reference data. This thesis presents an implementation of a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI), where such FE and reference model data can be correlated and set up for optimization in MSC.Nastran.
